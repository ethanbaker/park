# Matcher

Matcher is used to match students in pairs according to their interests, hobbies, and other attributes.

### Backend

The backend utilizes Python to handle matching scholars. A Word2Vec model is loaded to parametrize string inputs as vectors, which are later clustered using a k-means clustering algorithm.

### Frontend

The frontend uses Angular to provide a simple, understandable interface to access backend functionality. There are requirements for inputting csv files, a form input for submitting csv files for processing, and a results display and corresponding download.

### Testing

The testing folder holds resources that were used to test different functionalities of the project. Results and resources may be outdated to the current usage.
